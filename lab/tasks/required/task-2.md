2. [ ] In `./docs/roles-and-skills.md`:

     - [ ] In the `## Components and roles` section:
        - [ ] For each selected component from `architecture.md`, list IT roles that are likely involved in the development and maintenance of that component.
        - [ ] Use a nested list. Example:

          ```markdown  
          - Mobile app

            - QA
          - ...
          ```

     - [ ] In the `## Roles and responsibilities` section:
        - [ ] Select any five roles.
        - [ ] Consult an LLM or search engine to find out what are the typical responsibilities of these roles (what do people holding these role do?).
        - [ ] For each selected role, briefly describe the responsibilities.
     - [ ] In the `## Common skills across roles` section:
       - [ ] Based on your intuition and some research, list **tech skills that are required for these responsibilities**.
